Hello! 

I made a simple to do list using React. 

I used ES6 import and export to make use of multiple files and components. I have all the components in a seperate folder called components. 

I used @material-ui package to ease styling, I used it for typography and icons. 

I used two hooks; useEffect and useState.

The useEffect Hook lets you perform side effects in function components.

The useState Hook lets you add React state to function components. 

I tried to comment on any relative code blocks. 

Thanks!
